CLog
=====

A simple C89 logging library, licensed under [the zlib License](LICENSE).

Documentation for CLog can be found in [clog.h](include/clog/clog.h). Example
code is located in the `examples` folder and is licensed under
[CC0](examples/LICENSE).

No prebuilt versions of the library are available at this time, nor do I plan
to add them in the future.

Building
---------

CLog uses CMake to build. If you don't know how to use CMake, google it.

You can pass `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` to build the examples.
